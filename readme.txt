The Writer's Apprentice

Writing a novel is difficult when it is based in a fictional world. It is hard to delve into a distant reality and keep track of the storyline and all
the events when writers have to keep returning to this planet to work on their daily life. They need an application to keep track of the events,
characters, and story developments as they flitter between the fictional and real world. So far, there have only been applications as simple as an
editing interface, and perhaps a page noting down the genre and charactersâ€™ names, that exist with the intention of solving this problem. It
lacks more tools that provide a proper environment for writing. The app, hence, would include a character and event map, along with a basic
editing interface. It would take in the genre and provide the appropriate tips and background music regarding the genre, the setting of the
story, and time period. With every event that a character gets involved in, the app would track the changes in personality it brings so that the
app can detect when a future action a character makes is completely different from their personality. The app would be designed to help
writers retain the flow of the story and avoid plot holes
